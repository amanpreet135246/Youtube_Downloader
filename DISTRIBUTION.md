6. **Done!** Files are saved to their Downloads folder

## ⚙️ First-Time Setup (Optional)

## 🔧 Requirements

**None!** Everything is built into the single executable file.

Note: The first time they run it, Windows might show a security warning. They should click "More info" → "Run anyway" because it's not a signed executable.

## 📁 File Size

The executable is about 150-200MB because it includes:
- Python runtime
- PySide6 GUI framework
- yt-dlp downloader
- All necessary libraries

This is normal for standalone Python applications!
